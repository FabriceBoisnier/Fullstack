# Template-react-node-mongodb
A template to use with react on JSX, an API with node and mongoDB (some updates will come for react addons)

 docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
 Pour lancer les docker et les refresh sans avoir besoin de node sur votre machine...


# v0.1
The template include:

- react with ~~jsx (not TS for the moment will come soon)~~
- node with express and mongoDB connection (will be update as needed later)

~~SOON~~

~~- react router~~  
~~- zustand~~  
~~- react-icons~~  
~~- sass (and a base of index / root scss already available for reset)~~  
~~- Vitest (and jest/react-testing-library for testing code and a docker/command soon to test)~~  
~~- Structure architecture for the react folders (with pages/layer/components/assets/forms/routing/services/utils)~~  
~~- Dockerfile update for the dev time would be updated as needed~~

# v0.2

The template is just updated

- Tsx to use typescript, and interfaces folder.
- @lias for dev
- react router
- zustand
- react-icons (visit https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/ to have informations and details on how to use)
- sass (bases are includes, see the files on assets/styles to decrypt)
- Vitest (for jest and react testing library i'll search for best templates and installation before commit)
- Architecture updated as i use (with the alias it would be the best thing i've done :D)
- Dockerfile updated to copy your tsconfig and vite config in case...

# SOON
